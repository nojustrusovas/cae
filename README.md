**Chess Application and Engine** built using Python and the PyQt framework. Created originally as a **NEA** for my A-levels, but there are plans in place to finish all planned features. Currently there is no public release as this is a personal project, however documentation is available below for those who are interested in using the application.

### Manual Installation for macOS

* Copy the repository into the directory of your choice, and active the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
* Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Finally run the main file `main.py` via:
```bash
python main/main.py
```
* You must also have the Stockfish installed on your system at the path via:
```bash
brew install stockfish
```
*Make sure the stockfish path is located at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/stockfish/16/bin/stockfish`.*
